**UIX-FIX-02 — anchored overlays get viewport-collision handling and render in the top layer.**

Popover, the rich Select/menu, and Tooltip positioned themselves with CSS anchor positioning (`anchor()` / `position-anchor` / `anchor-size()`), which is Chromium-only: off-Chromium the overlay fell back to the UA-centered position and detached from its trigger, and even in Chromium there was no flip/shift so overlays clipped at the viewport edge. The CSS-only Tooltip (`[data-uix-tip]`) was also clipped by any `overflow: hidden/scroll` ancestor.

New, framework-agnostic positioning:

- **`computePosition(anchor, floating, viewport, options)`** (exported) — pure, dependency-free flip (opposite side when the preferred one won't fit) + shift (slide along the cross axis to stay on-screen). Unit-tested across every side/align, both flip directions, both shift edges, and oversized/degenerate inputs.
- **`useAnchoredPosition(anchor, floatingRef, { open, placement, offset, padding })`** (exported hook) — measures both elements with `getBoundingClientRect`, applies `position: fixed` + left/top, and keeps the overlay glued to its anchor on scroll/resize.

Component changes:

- **`Popover`** gains optional `anchor`, `placement`, and `offset` props. With `anchor` set it is placed with cross-browser JS positioning while the native Popover API still provides the top layer (escapes `overflow` clipping) and light-dismiss. Without `anchor` it behaves exactly as before.
- **`Tooltip`** now renders its bubble in the top layer via the Popover API, so it is never clipped by an `overflow` ancestor. Positioned with flip/shift, shown on hover and keyboard focus, dismissed on blur/Escape, and wired with `role="tooltip"` + `aria-describedby`. Its public props (`label`, children) are unchanged; a `placement` prop was added.

Tokens/CSS: adds `.uix-tooltip` / `.uix-tooltip__bubble` (top-layer bubble); the legacy `[data-uix-tip]` CSS tooltip is retained for back-compat but is superseded. The styleguide (`guide/app.js`) now positions all `.uix-popover` overlays and upgrades `[data-uix-tip]` tooltips through the same engine, so the vanilla and React layers behave identically.

Migration: `Popover`/`Tooltip` props are additive. If you targeted the old React `Tooltip`'s `[data-uix-tip]` output in your own CSS, switch to the `label` prop (the bubble is now `.uix-tooltip__bubble`).
