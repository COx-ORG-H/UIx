**UIX-FIX-04 — accessibility wiring for Field, Tree, and Toast.**

- **Field** — the error/hint/success message is now wired to the control with `aria-describedby` (so assistive tech announces it) and `aria-invalid` on error; the error carries `role="alert"` so it's announced the moment it appears. A `.uix-field__msg` slot with a reserved single-line `min-height` means an appearing error no longer shifts the layout. The React `Field` clones a single child control to attach the wiring, preserving any existing `aria-describedby`.
- **Tree** — rebuilt on the WAI-ARIA tree pattern. `role="tree"` / `role="treeitem"` / `role="group"`, `aria-level`, and `aria-expanded` / `aria-selected` now live on the treeitem `<li>` — `aria-selected` was previously (invalidly) on a `<button>`. The treeitem is the focusable element with a **roving tabindex** and full keyboard support (Up/Down, Left/Right to collapse/expand or move to parent/child, Home/End, Enter/Space to select). `.uix-tree__row` is now a presentational span.
- **Toast** — error/destructive toasts announce **assertively** (`role="alert"`, `aria-live="assertive"`); everything else stays polite (`role="status"`). The `Toaster` container is no longer a live region, so toasts are announced once instead of twice (it previously nested a live region inside a live region).

Verified with the repo's axe-core gate (`tests/a11y`, both themes, no serious/critical violations) plus keyboard-interaction checks.

Migration: component APIs are unchanged. Two DOM/CSS-contract notes for consumers who hand-author markup rather than using the components — (1) the `Tree`'s expand/select ARIA moved from the row to the treeitem `<li>`, and the child list is now `.uix-tree__group[role="group"]`; (2) the `Field` message now lives in a `.uix-field__msg` wrapper. Consumers using `<Tree>` / `<Field>` need no changes.
